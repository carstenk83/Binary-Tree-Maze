# Binary-Tree-Maze

The binary tree maze is represented by a binary search tree. Nodes in this tree represent places where the paths fork. 
They are also places at which our hero can earn some life points. They use one life point to get from one node to the 
next. When our hero starts on a particular path, they cannot go back. Some of the paths lead to trap 
doors (not a desirable scenario), others lead to exits. Your job is to supply a list of the paths that lead to exits. 
See example below for more details
